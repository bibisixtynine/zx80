# zx80.app, the online programmable computer

WARNING : this app is at its very early stage of development... less than ALPHA !

It looks like a smartphone home-screen, and (will) allow the use, (simplified) development, and (easy) share of webapps.

Although this app works online, it is also designed to be installed locally (it is a PWA). It will be then available offline like a 'classic' app ! (see how at the end of this page)

For the installation process, use :
- iPod/iPhone/iPad : Apple Safari
- OSX, Windows, Linux : Google Chrome (or Microsoft Edge)

# Why this app ?

- Target audience : anyone who would like to learn coding and share apps than can be installed on any platform, even with a 'small' iphone 13 mini (I love to code with my iphone mini ðŸ¤“)

- Ease the very begining of the learning curve of coding apps

- No need of developper account, apple store or google store, specific hardware configuration : just a computer, tablet or smartphone with any operating system... able to run Safari (ios) or Google Chrome

- 'modern' javascript is used for coding
